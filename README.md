📌 **PROJECT OVERVIEW**

This project develops a machine learning model to predict the likelihood of  Diabetes in patients based on medical attributes such as Demographics: (Age & Pregnancies), Clinical Measurements: (Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin & Body Mass Index), Genetic Risk: (Diabetes Pedigree Function), and Target: Outcome.The goal is to provide a data-driven tool that can support healthcare professionals in early detection and risk assessment of diabetes.

🎯 **OBJECTIVE**

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing on the Diabetic Patients dataset.

- Conduct exploratory data analysis (EDA) to understand patterns and correlations.

- Build, train, and evaluate multiple classification models (e.g., Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, SVM & Random Forest).

- Select the best-performing model for prediction.

- Deploy the model for real-world usability.


📂**DATASET:** 🩺 Diabetes Data Report
- Features include: Demographics: (Age & Pregnancies), Clinical Measurements: (Glucose, Blood Pressure, Skin Thickness, Insulin & Body Mass Index), Genetic Risk: (Diabetes Pedigree Function), and Target: Outcome.
- Target: 0 = None Diabetic Patient & 1 = Diabetic Patient

🔍 **EXPLORATORY DATA ANALYSIS (EDA)

- Distribution of patient attributes.
- Correlation heatmap between features and target.
- Outlier detection and handling.
- Class imbalance check

🤖 **MODELS IMPLEMENTED**

- 📉 Logistic Regression.
- ⚖ Support Machine Vector (SMV).
- 🌲 Decision Tree.
- 🌲🌲🌲 Random Forest

**EVALUATION METRICS:**
- Accuracy

- F1-score


📈 **FUTURE IMPROVEMENTS**

- Hyperparameter tuning with GridSearchCV/Optuna.
- Use ensemble methods or XGBoost/LightGBM for better accuracy.
- Deploy model as a web API (Flask/FastAPI).
- Integrate with healthcare dashboards.
